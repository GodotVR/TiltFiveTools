## Tilt Five Tools Player Node
##
## This node is a T5XRRig with additional capabilities to work with the
## Tilt Five Tools Staging, Scene, and Character features. Applications should
## create a custom player scene extending from this scene/node to customize the
## player - for example to adjust the visible layers or add pointers.

# Tilt Five Tools

This asset provides numerous helper scripts and nodes that work with
[TiltFiveGodot4](https://github.com/GodotVR/TiltFiveGodot4) for developing
Tilt Five experiences and games.


## General Concepts

### Wand Inputs

The Tilt Five wand is represented in Godot as a T5Controller3D. This node
emits signals when the inputs are used.

For button presses the `button_pressed(name : String)` and 
`button_released(name : String)` signals use the following names:
* "button_a"
* "button_b"
* "button_x"
* "button_y"
* "button_1"
* "button_2"
* "button_3"
* "button_t5"
* "trigger_click"

The trigger input is reported as "trigger" in the
`input_float_changed(name : String, value : float)` signal.

The joystick input is reported as "stick" in the
`input_vector2_changed(name : String, value : Vector2)` signal.


### Visual Layers

As Tilt Five is designed to work with multiple local players, it is sometimes
necessary to limit what content is visible to the different players. This can
be achieved using visual layers and camera cull masks. The following are the
layer assignments used by Tilt Five Tools:
* [1] Visible by Everyone
* [2] Visible by Spectator
* [3] Visible by All Players
* [11] Visible to Player 1
* [12] Visible to Player 2
* [13] Visible to Player 3
* [14] Visible to Player 4


### Physics Layers

Similar to Visual Layers, four physics layers are reserved for the players.

* [11] Collision for Player 1
* [12] Collision for Player 2
* [13] Collision for Player 3
* [14] Collision for Player 4


### Staging

Staging is the the infrastructure for loading and switching between game scenes.
The components are named and behave like a theater:
* Staging: The stage where scenes are loaded and played
* Scene: An environment constructed on a stage for playing in
* Player: A user playing a role in the game
* Character: A role in the game performed by a player

## FAQ

### Where to Begin

The following constructs a basic application with a cube on the board.

1. Construct a custom "player" scene inheriting from staging/player.tscn and save it
   in the game folder. This can be modified to add pointers, spectator meshes for
   glasses and wands, and player-specific popup menus.
2. Construct a custom "start" scene inheriting from staging/scene.tscn and save it
   in the game folder. This will contain the scene objects. Add a simple 0.1 meter
   cube mesh in there to test.
3. Construct a custom "main" scene inheriting from staging/staging.tscn and save it
   in the game folder. Set the "Start Scene" property to point to the custom "start"
   scene. In the T5Manager node set the "Glasses Scene" to point to the custom
   "player" scene. Set this "main" scene as the Godot Main Scene.

Pressing play in Godot should start the game, load the start scene, and show the
cube in the middle of the Tilt Five game pad.


### Create a Popup Menu

The following steps add a popup menu that shows when the user presses the T5 button
on the wand.

1. Construct a new "popup menu" 2D scene and save it in the game folder. Populate
   the 2D scene with suitable controls and buttons as desired for the popup menu.
2. Open the custom "player" scene and add a new Node3D called "Menu" under the
   "Origin" node (which represents the center of the game-board). Under the "Menu"
   node add a VisibleToggle node and a FacePlayer node. These will cause the
   node to toggle visibility when the T5 Menu button (this can be customized) is
   pressed, and to face towards the player.
3. Under the "Menu" node add a Viewport2Din3D called "Popup" and set its Scene to
   the "popup menu" scene. Enable Unshaded otherwise the popup will use the lighting
   of the stage and environment.
4. To prevent other players from seeing or interacting with the popup menu, disable
   all Visible and Collision layers. The correct player-only collision and visible
   layers will be enabled at runtime depending on which player pops open the menu.


### Scaling the World

Many assets are designed for real-world scale; however the Tilt Five board is
only around 1 meter in size. The easiest way to solve this is to change the 
"Gameboard Scale" property in the custom "player" Origin node. A value of 10
will shrink items in the board making them 10x smaller.


### Creating Characters for Players

1. Construct a new custom "character" scene inheriting from "staging/character.tscn"
   and save it in the game folder.

2. Add an appropriate character body object (E.G. CharacterBody3D or RigidBody3D)
   to the scene, and add a control script to it. Two demo control scripts have
   been provided to show how control can be implemented:
   * objects/controllers/characterbody_controller.gd
   * objects/controllers/rigidbody_controller.gd


### Center Game Board on Character

The demo character body controller scripts already have an option to do this by
moving the players Origin node (the center of the game board) to match the
position of the character body.


### World/Player State

The state of the world and the players can be maintained in a custom autoload
singleton script which would be accessible from everywhere. Additionally the
Staging node contains a "data" dictionary which can be used to hold any custom
information.

The application is responsible for implementing a persistence mechanism for
save files. There are numerous articles available on implementing this feature:
